This is a project at first inspired into Jonas Schmedtmann project "Bankist" on Udemy [link](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/)
<br>
I saw some features that i could work on to improve, and at the current stage of project i'm using a few different approachs that the ones used by Jonas.

## TRANSFER & REQUEST MONEY

<br>
We transfer just with a push into the movements array with the valor of the transfer, if user 1 is transfering 200$ to user 2, we will add a -200 element into user 1 movements and a 200 element into user 2 movements array. <br><br>
To do the request we create another array which will store all requests that are done into the app.



## CREATE ACCOUNT

<br>
This project work with localStorage to store and manage all accounts, each action done into the site will be parsed to the localStorage then retrieved to JavaScript again.
