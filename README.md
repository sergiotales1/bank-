# bank-
This is a project at first inspired into Jonas Schmedtmann project "Bankist" on Udemy [link](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/)

I saw some features that i could work on to improve, and at the current stage of project i'm using a few different approachs that the ones used by Jonas.
This project work with localStorage to store all accounts, it have a new feature which allows the user to request money to another account registered and a lot of other features...

Still working on updates!
