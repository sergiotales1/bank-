login() :
will login into the account established using username and pin input values.
executes webStoreAccounts() search for currentAccount and store the correspondent array
sets currentAccount.active to true and store it into localStorage


displayUI(movements) : 
is a function that retrieve movements array and will display into the movements container every row of the transition including value, index and if its a deposit or withdrawal
using getItem we retrieve from localStorage with a forEach the account that have the active property set to true, them we use this account to display the movements array on the UI.

webStoreAccounts() :
sets all accounts.active to false and store them into localStorage.

PROBLEMS: 

2- we need to clean or code because those localStorage mess is looking ugly, we need a function to do this, and we need to implement a way to get the balance and update it with the transfer event handler.
webStoreAccounts() is too limited and we need some function that update the localStorage after some change (movement or status, etc...)
1- when we reload the page to pass from the login.html to app we lost the currentAccount object, need to implement some way of persist that information.
*** SOLUTION 1 - implement the localStorage and use it to persist and retrieve the data
